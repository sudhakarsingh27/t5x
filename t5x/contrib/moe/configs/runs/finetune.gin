# Fine-tune a Mixture of Experts model.
#
# This file allows for fine-tuning with data, expert and model parallelism.
#
#
# You must also include bindings for MODEL and NUM_EXPERTS (typically set by the
# model gin config).
#
# Required to be set:
#
# - NUM_MODEL_PARTITIONS or MODEL_PARALLEL_SUBMESH (only specify one)
# - MIXTURE_OR_TASK_NAME
# - TASK_FEATURE_LENGTHS
# - TRAIN_STEPS  # includes pretrain steps
# - MODEL_DIR
# - INITIAL_CHECKPOINT_PATH
#
# Commonly overridden options (see also t5x/configs/runs/finetune.gin):
#
# - DROPOUT_RATE
# - BATCH_SIZE
# - Trainer.num_microbatches
